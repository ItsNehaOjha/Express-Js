template engines like ejs in backend 

 ejs is html used as template engine to use html not like the previously I did by
h1 h2 tags  to add a proper html files in backend file we use ejs for html to 
make things dynamic .

steps to setup ejs 
1: ejs install by : npm i ejs
2: configure ejs in scripts.js by: app.set("view engine", "ejs")

3: ek views folder bnao    !! views not view
4: views me ek ejs file bnao by: index.ejs (this will be a simple html file)
5: send ki jagah render kr do script file me as: 
        app.get('/', function (req, res) {
            res.send('Hello World')   --> res.render('index')
        })
NOTE!! 
 make sure render krte waqt hm views folder ke ander wali hi file ka nam 
likhe aur usme ejs extension na lgaye to jo bh file likhenge whi render hoke aayegi

also during rendering we can give some data that we want to load dynamically
for that : 
   res.render('index', {age:12});

   now wherever there is age in ejs file we can show value 12 by writting in thi format: 
   <h1>age: <%= age%></h1>
